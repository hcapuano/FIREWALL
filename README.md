# FIREWALL
Python firewall for every OS

This Firewall made with Python is a year-end project.  
To realize this project we used Python and the scapy library to read network packets. There is also netfilterqueue which allows to redirect packets to our program.  

There are 3 programs, one to compare each received packets with rules stored in the database. Another to insert rules according to specific criteria.  
The last one permite to remove a rule according to the position.
